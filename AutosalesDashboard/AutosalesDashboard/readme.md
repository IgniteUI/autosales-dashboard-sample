##About the Sample
[The Auto Sales Dashboard sample](http://igniteui.com/application-samples#salesdashboard) highlights the capabilities of the Ignite UI map, data chart, grid, and bullet graph controls integrated into a single application. The dashboard provides sales and revenue information at a glance so users can obtain high-level aggregated data or drill down for sales specifics by region, model, dealership, and product line. In this showcase from the top left you could change revenue type, the region that you are observing and the period for which you want to see results. From the tabs bellow you could drill-down into details views about dealers, car models and regions.
